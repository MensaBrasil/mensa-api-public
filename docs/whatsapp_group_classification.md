## WhatsApp Group Types

WhatsApp groups are separated into:

- **MB Groups**: Adult Mensans are allowed to join these groups.
- **JB Groups**: Mensans aged between 10 and 17 years are eligible to join these groups.
- **M.JB Groups**: Mensans under the age of 10 are eligible to join these groups.
- **R.JB Groups**: Legal representatives, whether they are Mensans or not, are allowed to join these groups.

### Age Transition Rule

If a **M.JB member turns 10**, they will no longer be allowed to join **M.JB groups**.
However, they will **not be removed from existing M.JB groups until they turn 12**.

If a **JB member turns 18**, they will no longer be allowed to join **JB groups** and will be removed from **JB groups**.
