IAM API DOCUMENTATION
=====================

This document outlines the naming conventions and usage guidelines for managing Identity and Access Management (IAM) in Mensa-API. It details the syntax rules for creating names for groups, roles, and permissions, along with best practices on when to use groups versus roles.

------------------------
NAMING CONVENTIONS
------------------------
1. NO SPACES ALLOWED:
   - Names for groups, roles, and permissions must not contain spaces and must be written in uppercase.
   - Use dots (.) to separate words or segments.

2. ALLOWED FORMAT EXAMPLES:
   - ROLES:
     - D.REGIONAL
     - TESOUREIRO
     - D.MARKETING
     - SECRETARIO
   - GROUPS:
     - BETA.TESTER
     - SIG.MATEMATICA
   - PERMISSIONS:
     - EVENT.CREATE
     - EVENT.EDIT
     - EVENT.DELETE
     - WHATSAPP.BOT

------------------------
WHEN TO USE GROUPS, ROLES, AND PERMISSIONS
------------------------
GROUPS:
   - PURPOSE: Groups are used for broad, general assignments that provide a baseline set of permissions or access.
   - USE CASE EXAMPLES:
     - A group like BETA.TESTER may grant its members access to unreleased features.
     - A group like SIG.MATEMATICA might grant members access to features exclusive to members of the mathematics SIG.

ROLES:
   - PURPOSE: Roles are used for more specific assignments that require finer-grained control, often associated with official positions such as president, treasurer, or secretary.
   - USE CASE EXAMPLES:
     - A role such as DIRETOR.REGIONAL or DIRETOR.MARKETING might carry specific responsibilities and access rights.
     - A specialized role (e.g., ADMIN) might have the authority to delegate roles, groups, and permissions to other users.

PERMISSIONS:
   - PURPOSE: Permissions define the specific actions or operations that can be performed within the system.
   - USE CASE EXAMPLES:
     - A permission like CREATE.EVENT grants the ability to create new events.
     - Permissions can be assigned to both groups and roles to fine-tune access control.

------------------------
Following these guidelines ensures a well-organized, secure, and manageable IAM strategy for Mensa-API.
